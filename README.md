# BangTour


Despite the availability of various travel apps, many tourists still face difficulties in finding the most suitable and authentic travel experiences that match their preferences and interests. Many Places left unexplored because of their distances and exposure. This could lead to many people getting bored of the same tourist destinations, which could impact their holiday experience. From those problems, we want to tackle those problems in order to provide those experiences back when they first travelled to their destination. Which still suffice their preferences. Tourism industry has always been a significant contributor to the global economy, providing a lot of job opportunities, especially to local Small Medium Enterprises(SMEs). With the Covid Outbreak already passed, the tourism industry started to revive itself with the increasing number of tourists. What have we done to accommodate those problem are : 

Machine Learning	: the machine learning part we use are first using the recommendation based on the rating that the user want and then it will be feed into the model, the model then processed it and give us a recommendation based on user preference. this output will be used as a recommendation for the future use 

Mobile Development: Our application uses Android Components such as ViewModel, LiveData, Repository, Local data resource and MVVM. We implement Clean Architecture as our Architecture App. Don't forget, we also use several libraries such as Retrofit, Firebase Auth, Gson and RecycleView Etc.

Cloud Computing: uploading data from csv to firebase format to cloud firestore, deploying API for database query for firestore at app engine, deploying ML model API using compute engine with load balancing with https supported and being mapped with Cloud DNS
